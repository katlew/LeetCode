Maintain two pointers â€“ reference pointer and main pointer. 
Initialize both reference and main pointers to head. 
First move reference pointer to n nodes from head. 
Now move both pointers one by one until reference pointer 
reaches end. Now main pointer will point to nth node 
from the end. Return main pointer.
